CSW Java APIs
=============

This project provides Java (8) APIs for the CSW classes.
These are thin wrappers, implemented in Scala and Java, that translate between
Scala and Java types. Java APIs are provided for all the CSW subprojects:

* [Command and Control Service (ccs)](README.ccs.md)
* [Config Service (cs)](README.cs.md)

(TBD...)
