Shared Scala / Scala.js Classes
===============================

All classes in the project are compiled to both the JVM and JavaScript.
These should be simple data transfer classes with no Java dependencies.

The classes defined here are to be used in REST APIs exchanging data 
(in JSON format, for example).
