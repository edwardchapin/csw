== CCS - Command and Control Service ==

The ccs project defines the basic classes and traits for the ''Command and Control Service''.

Related projects are the ''util'' project, which defines the types for ''configurations'' and the
''kvs'' project, which defines a key/value store, which can be used to set/get state variables.

This is an [[http://akka.io/ Akka actor]] based project.
The main actors (or actor traits) here are:

- '''AssemblyController''' - trait for an actor that accepts configurations for an Assembly and communicates with
    one or more HCDs or other assemblies before replying with a command status

- '''HcdController''' - trait for an actor that accepts configurations (from an Assembly) for an HCD.
    The HCD controller sets a state variable, which is used by the assembly to determine when a command has completed.

- '''PeriodicHcdController''' - like HcdController, but has a Queue of configurations that it checks at a specified rate.
    This controller wakes up regularly, checks the incoming queue and updates its state variable with the current
    state of the HCD.

- '''StateMatcherActor''' - an actor used to match demand and current state and then notify a given actor
