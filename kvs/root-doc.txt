== Key/Value Store and Publish/Subscribe ==

This module provides key/value store and publish/subscribe features based on [[http://redis.io/ Redis]].
An Event object can be set or published on a channel and subscribers
receive the events. The last ''n'' events are saved for reference (where n is an optional argument).

Note that the tests assume the redis server is running.
