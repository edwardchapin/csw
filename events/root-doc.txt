== Event Service, Key/Value Store and Publish/Subscribe ==

This module provides event service, key/value store and publish/subscribe features based on [[http://redis.io/ Redis]].
An event or configuration object can be set or published on a channel and subscribers
can receive the events. The last n events are always saved for reference (where n is an optional argument).

Note that the tests assume the redis server is running. The host and port for the Redis instance can be configured
in resources/application.conf or reference.conf, or you can use the
[[https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw/tree/master/apps/trackLocation trackLocation]] application to register a
Redis instance with the location service and then look up the host and port to use for it.

== Telemetry Service ==

The TelemetryService defined in this project uses an EventService containing `StatusEvents`.
The API is slightly simpler than the generic `EventService`, since the type is known
(Keys and not required, since it uses the event's prefix as a key).

See the unit tests for some examples of the usage.
